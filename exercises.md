## Exercise 1

Write a program that reads a grid (from a file named `grid.txt` in the current directory) that represents a maze
and checks if it is possible to exit the maze or not.

The entry is the cell that contains the `S` character and the exit contains the `E` character.

Here are some examples of mazes:

```
S.#.....#.....#....#
#.#.###.#.###.#.##.#
#.#...#.#.#.#.#.#..#
#.###.#.#.#.#.#.#.##
#.#...#...#.#.#.#..#
#.#.#######.#.#.##.#
#.#.........#.#....#

#.#.###.#.#.##.#.#.#
#.#.#...#.#.#..#.#.#
#.#.#.###.#.#.##.#.#
#.#.#.....#.#....#.#
#.#.#######.######.E
```

```
##########
S.....#..#
#.##.#.##.
#.#..#...#
#.#.###.#.
#...#.#.#.
###.#.#.#.
#...#.#.#E
#.###.#..#

```
